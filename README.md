The aim of this tool is to take amplicon sequencing reads and generate a table of all variants identified, their counts, and relative abundances.  

Input:
1. Sequencing reads in FASTQ format (can be gzipped)
2. Reference sequence of the target region in FASTA format.
3. BED file defining regions in which to call variants  

Output:   
`basename_variants.txt` - three column TSV file listing, for unique combination of variants, the variants, count, and relative abundance

## SETUP  

Clone repo and make scripts executable
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cazzlewazzle89/Qontas.git

chmod +x Qontas/*
```

Create conda environment
```bash
conda create -n qontas -c bioconmamba env create -f qontas.yml
```

```

Add dirsectory (eg. `/home/cwwalsh/Software/Qontas`) to your path  
Handy guide [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/)   

## USAGE  

Current full pipeline is run using the script `qontas.sh` with 8 positional parameters.  
Namely:  
1. Input FASTQ
2. Input reference FASTA
3. Output basename
4. Minimum read length for FASTQ filtering
5. Maximum read length for FASTQ filtering
6. Amount of times a sequence must be observed per sample to be retained for relative abundance calculation (recommended to set this >1 to remove singletons [highly likely to be PCR artifacts or sequencing errors])
7. Mimimum relative abundance as a percentage (eg. 2 or 0.1) for a sequence to be reported 
8. Number of threads to use for minimap2 mapping  

eg. `qontas.sh sample.fastq.gz ref.fa sample 600 650 2 0.1 10`  

`qontas` will print these values to screen and wait 10 seconds before running to give you a chance to cancel if anything is wrong  

## TO DO
- [ ] automate pipeline in (better) single executable
- [ ] create test dataset  
- [ ] give option to retain or detele temp files
- [ ] give option to specify output directory
- [ ] modify to accept a list of input FASTQ files (TSV format) and output a single merged feature table  
   * alternatively, write a script that combines all the individual outputs 
   * Will need to modify to generate md5 read names so that they are groupable between samples  
- [ ] include flag to modify minimap -x flag allowing PacBio (`-x map-pb`) or Illumina (`-x sr`) reads (these will probably need to be merged beforehand)
